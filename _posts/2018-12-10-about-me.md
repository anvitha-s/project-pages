## About me
I am a senior undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay(IIT B) majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am interested in studying the mechanics behind morphogenesis and soft matter physics.

I like to play around with code, read fiction and comics, and debate the phiosophy of life in my free time. More recently my reading list that was predominantly psychological thrillers has been taken over by behavioural economics and biology.
